# Network-Security
This assignment covers firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), network security monitoring (NSM) and Enterprise security management (ESM).

This week is an introduction to network security from both a theoretical and practical standpoint. I explored the benefits of using defense in depth methodologies and how firewalls serve as the network's primary defense mechanism at both the perimeter and interior of the network.

A critical skill of the network defender is to not only be able to stop an attack but also to learn from them. I explored in great detail how to establish situational awareness of our networks using detailed data analytics to learn about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) that adversaries use to successfully infiltrate networks.

•	Day 1 introduces firewalls. I examined the relationship between ports and services, including the role open ports play as the principal attack surface of networked machines. Then, I reviewed how firewalls are used to control access to a machine's open ports.

•	Day 2 covers intrusion detection systems (IDS) and network security monitoring (NSM). I analyzed indicators of attack and compromise (IOAs and IOCs), perform network forensics, and acquire adversarial intelligence and situational awareness of our networks.

•	Day 3 focuses on threat hunting using the Enterprise security management (ESM) framework of network security tools. I examined ESM concepts and the role of host-based endpoint telemetry, simulate investigations, and perform alert triage using Kibana.
